	 * Hi, here's your problem today.
	 * This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:
	 * <p>
	 * You are given an array of integers.
	 * Return the length of the longest increasing
	 * subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) in the array.
	 * <p>
	 * Example:
	 * [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]
	 * <p>
	 * The following input should return 6 since the
	 * longest increasing subsequence is 0, 2, 6, 9 , 11, 15.
